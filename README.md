## README.md Generator   [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)



## Description
We were tasked with creating a command line tool to help make creating README.md files easier. The tool is designed to take user inputs and apply them to the corrisponding sections of a readme file and create the file. The user will be prompted to provide a title of the project, a description of the project, any installation instructions, any usage instructions, choose a license for the project, provide instructions for how others can contribute, describe any tests and how to use them, and a section with contact information for any additional questions.
